            You went to a party
            I heard from everybody
            You part the crowd like the Red Sea
            Don't even get me started
            Did you get anxious though
            On the way home?
            I guess I'll never, ever know
            Now that we don't talk
            
            You grew your hair long
            You got new icons
            And from the outside
            It looks like you're tryin' lives on
            I miss the old ways
            You didn't have to change
            But I guess I don't have a say
            Now that we don't talk

            I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
            Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
            I cannot be your friend
            So I pay the price of what I lost
            And what it cost
            Now that we don't talk

            What do you tell your friends we
            Shared dinners, long weekends with
            Truth is I can't pretend it's
            Platonic, it's just ended

            So I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (off my chest)
            Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left ('til I left)
            I cannot be your friend
            So I pay the price of what I lost (of what I lost)
            And what it cost
            Now that we don't talk

            I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
            Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
            With important men who think important thoughts
            Guess maybe I am better off
            Now that we don't talk
            And the only way back to my dignity
            Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
            Just like I had been when you were chasing me
            Guess this is how it was to be
            Now that we don't talk
